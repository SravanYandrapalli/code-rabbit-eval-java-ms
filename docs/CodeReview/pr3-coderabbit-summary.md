- _🛠️ Refactor suggestion_  **Run as non-root and fix file ownership in the runtime image.**  Containers should not run as root; set a dedicated UID and chown the jar.   ```diff -FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre -WORKDIR /app -COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar -EXPOSE 8080 -ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app/app.jar"] +FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre +WORKDIR /app +# Create non-root user +RUN useradd -r -u 10001 app +# Copy jar and set ownership +COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar /app/app.jar +
- _💡 Verification agent_  <details> <summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>  **Upgrade Spring Boot BOM to pick patched Tomcat; multiple critical CVEs flagged.**  OSV flags critical Tomcat issues via 3.3.3’s transitive set. Bump to the latest 3.3.x patch to consume fixed Tomcat automatically.

- _⚠️ Potential issue_  **Guard against missing PRs to avoid null dereference.**  If no PRs are returned, `$pr` is `$null` and `$pr.number` throws.   ```diff  if (-not $PrNumber) {    $prs = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{ 'User-Agent'='coderabbit-fetch'; 'Accept'='application/vnd.github+json' } -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/$Owner/$Repo/pulls?state=open"    if (-not $prs) {      $prs = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{ 'User-Agent'='coderabbit-fetch'; 'Accept'='application/vnd.github+json' } -Ur
- _🛠️ Refactor suggestion_  **Remove hard-coded “pr1*” outputs; make filenames per-PR to avoid overwrites.**  Write artifacts under docs/CodeReview/pr$PrNumber-*. Also ensure parent dir exists.   ```diff -New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path 'docs/CodeReview/pr1-suggested-patches' | Out-Null +New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path 'docs/CodeReview' | Out-Null +$outPrefix = "docs/CodeReview/pr$PrNumber" +New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$outPrefix-suggested-patches" | Out-Null 
- _🛠️ Refactor suggestion_  **Bind to the canonical property key, not the env var name.**  Use `app.secret` (mapped from APP_SECRET) to leverage Spring’s relaxed binding and config files.   ```diff -    @Value("${APP_SECRET:}") +    @Value("${app.secret:}")      private String appSecret; ```  <!-- suggestion_start -->  <details> <summary>📝 Committable suggestion</summary>  > ‼️ **IMPORTANT** > Carefully review the code before committing.

- _🛠️ Refactor suggestion_  **Do not commit build artifacts (target/*).**  This file should be generated, not versioned. Commiting it risks drift and accidental leaks.   Actions: - Delete target/classes/application.yml from VCS. - Add target/ to .gitignore:  ```gitignore # Maven target/ ```  <details> <summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>  ``` In target/classes/application.yml (lines 1-10): this is a generated build artifact and must be removed from version control; delete target/classes/a
