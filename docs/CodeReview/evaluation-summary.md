## CodeRabbit Evaluation Summary

### Findings overview
- PR#1: see `docs/CodeReview/pr1-coderabbit-summary.md`
- PR#3 (fixes): see `docs/CodeReview/pr3-coderabbit-summary.md`
- Direct comparison: `docs/CodeReview/comparison-pr1-vs-pr3.md`

### Improvements in PR#3 vs PR#1
- Javadocs: added for public classes/methods (violations reduced to zero)
- System.out: replaced with SLF4J logging
- Secrets: removed hard-coded placeholder; using env-backed property (`app.secret`)
- Thread-safety: static mutable cache replaced by `ConcurrentHashMap`
- Exception handling: eliminated swallow; parameter validation added
- Formatting: standardized via `.editorconfig`
- Dependencies: upgraded commons-io; Spring Boot patch upgrade recommended by CodeRabbit
- Tests: added service tests; coverage stub recorded in `test-coverage-summary.md`
- Folder naming: removed misnamed directory violating package conventions

### Outstanding/future items (from PR#3 review)
- Harden Docker image (non-root user, file ownership)
- Consider bumping Spring Boot to latest 3.3.x patch per SCA findings
- Avoid committing build outputs; ensure `target/` is ignored in VCS
- Prefer property binding classes (`@ConfigurationProperties`) for config

### Team rule mapping
- coverage >= 80%: improved with additional tests (see stub summary)
- no-hardcoded-secrets: addressed
- folder-naming: addressed
- forbid-system-out: addressed
- formatting: addressed
- javadoc-required: addressed
- secrets-by-env: `app.secret` via config/env
- security-checks: dependency bumps, further upgrades noted
- exception-handling: addressed
- thread-safety-checks: addressed

### Value unlocked
- Reduced findings and severities between PR#1 and PR#3
- Clear alignment with team rules and security posture
- Reproducible, documented artifacts for audits and onboarding
