- _🛠️ Refactor suggestion_  **Harden image, improve build caching, and avoid root.**  - Cache deps by copying pom + .mvn before sources. - Run as non-root and set ownership on the jar. - Optionally set sane JVM memory defaults.   ```diff -FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk AS build -WORKDIR /app -COPY . . -RUN ./mvnw -q -DskipTests package || mvn -q -DskipTests package - -FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre -WORKDIR /app -COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar -EXPOSE 8080 -ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/ap
- _💡 Verification agent_  <details> <summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>  **Bump Spring Boot to latest 3.3.x patch to pull patched Tomcat/Framework transitive deps.**  Scanner flags multiple Tomcat and Spring MVC issues on 3.3.3’s transitive set. Upgrade to the newest 3.3.x.  Please confirm latest stable and update property:  ---  🌐 Web query:  ```web What is the latest Spring Boot 3.3.x patch version and does it address recent Tomcat CVEs? ```  💡 Result:  - Latest Spring Boot 3.3.x patch: 3.
- _💡 Verification agent_  <details> <summary>❓ Verification inconclusive</summary>  **Upgrade or remove vulnerable commons-io 2.6.**  2.6 has known vulns (path traversal, XML DoS). If unused, drop it; otherwise bump to a safe version.   Option A – remove if unused: ```diff -        <dependency> -            <groupId>commons-io</groupId> -            <artifactId>commons-io</artifactId> -            <version>2.6</version> -        </dependency> ```  Option B – upgrade with a pinned property: ```d
- _🛠️ Refactor suggestion_  **Replace System.out with structured logging (SLF4J).**  Avoid `System.out.println` in production paths; use SLF4J with parameterized messages. Also add a logger field.   ```diff  import org.model.User;  import org.service.UserService;  import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;  import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated;  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;  im
- _💡 Verification agent_  <details> <summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>  **Base package “org” is too broad; rename to a project-specific package.**  Using package org triggers component scanning across many third‑party org.* classes, increasing startup time and risk of accidental bean pickup. Move code to something like com.coderabbit.eval (or your org domain) and update package declarations accordingly.    Proposed change for this file (after repo-wide package rename):  ```diff -package org; 
- _🛠️ Refactor suggestion_  **Don’t read env directly with @Value; bind via properties and fail fast if missing.**  Use @ConfigurationProperties + @Validated + @NotBlank to bind app.secret and avoid defaulting to empty (silent misconfig). Aligns with application.yml and secrets-by-env policy.  Apply:  ```diff -import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value; +import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties; +import org.springframework.validation.annotation.V
- _🛠️ Refactor suggestion_  **Folder naming violates Java package conventions.**  Directories under src/main/java must mirror package names (all lowercase). Either: - Move this note to docs/ (preferred), or - Rename folder to src/main/java/org/service/ if you truly need a service package.  <details> <summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>  ``` In src/main/java/org/Service_misnamed/Readme.txt lines 1-3, the folder name "Service_misnamed" violates Java package naming conventions (directories u
